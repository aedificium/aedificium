IMPORTANT: Don't use these .po files for translations, only use the .po files
           in pootle!

All translations are handled through pootle [1] and the .po files in this
directory should only be touched when syncing with pootle (which should happen
regularly so users of the Git repository can test the translations).

[1]: http://pootle.unknown-horizons.org/

To update unknown-horizons.pot run

    ./development/create_pot.sh

If the .po files should also be updated run (which calls msgmerge)

    ./development/create_pot.sh -u

If necessary guitranslations.py, which contains translatable strings from XML
files, must be updated first, this can be done with

    python development/extract_strings_from_xml.py horizons/i18n/guitranslations.py

To generate the .mo files in build/ which are necessary to use the
translations run

    ./setup.py build_i18n

setup.py only builds the .mo files (and generates unknown-horizons.desktop),
no other translation related work is handled by it.

At the moment ./setup.py build_i18n removes po/unknown-horizons.pot but it can
easily be recreated with commands given above.
