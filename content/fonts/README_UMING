CJK Unicode font Ming style
===========================

This font was taken from the from the TrueType fonts generously released by 
Arphic Technologies Taiwan under the Arphic Public License.
It was modified with Fontforge by Arne Goetje <arne@ubuntu.com> to contain 
both Big5 and GB2312 charsets plus some European characters.

Currently it fully supports the following charsets:
ISO8859-1,2,3,4,7,9,10,13,14,15
Big5
HKSCS-2004
GB2312-80
Bopomofo Extensions for Hakka, Minnan (Unicode 5.0) and their MBE variants. 

Partly support is implemented for:
CNS 11643
GBK
GB18030
Japanese
Korean

This font is under development, new glyphs for the partly supported charsets 
are constantly added.

This font is a TrueType Collection containing 4 flavors, namely 
CN, HK, TW and TW MBE. Please see NEWS, KNOWN_ISSUES, FONTLOG and TODO for 
details.

==

This release contains Firefly's Bitmap fonts. The Bitmap fonts are available
for 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 pixel and currently cover Big5 and GB2312.
HKSCS is currently not supported as there are many more characters missing.
So, for Big5 and GB2312 characters the bitmap glyphs should improve the
rendering, but for all other characters, the rendering is the same like
without bitmap glyphs.

If you want to help to improve the situation, please contact me:
